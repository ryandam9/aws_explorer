# CloudWatch Logs TUI Usage

An interactive explorer for CloudWatch log groups, streams and events, with
filtering, search and live tailing.

```bash
./bin/aws_explorer cw [flags]
```

The global `--profile`, `--auth-method`, `--role-arn`, `--region` and
`--all-regions` flags apply: `--region` pins a single region, `--all-regions`
sweeps every enabled region and adds a Region column to the group list, and
otherwise the config's `aws.regions` list is used.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--group` / `-g` | — | Initial log group filter/pattern |
| `--stream` / `-s` | — | Initial log stream filter |
| `--filter` / `-f` | — | Initial query pattern for log events |
| `--since` | `24h` | Event query window, e.g. `30m`, `2h`, `3d` |
| `--theme` | `spotted-pardalote` | UI theme name |

```bash
# Browse log groups in one region
./bin/aws_explorer cw --region us-east-1

# Open a group and search for errors
./bin/aws_explorer cw -g /aws/lambda/my-fn -f ERROR

# Only scan the last 30 minutes of events (faster on busy groups)
./bin/aws_explorer cw -g /aws/lambda/my-fn --since 30m
```

Press `o` on a log group to open it in the CloudWatch console (URL copied;
browser opened when the session is local). Press `?` anywhere — including
inside the full log viewer — for the full key reference; the status bar only
shows the keys usable right now (eliding on narrow terminals).

### Map of the UI

Every surface has a fixed name (shown in its heading), so docs, the `?` help
overlay, and conversations can refer to them unambiguously. The numbers match
the Tab-cycle order.

| Name | What it is |
|------|------------|
| **Browser** | The main screen: the sidebar plus one right-hand panel |
| **[1] Log groups** | Sidebar listing groups across the region scope |
| **[2] Log streams** | Right panel: the selected group's streams |
| **[3] Log events** | Right panel: events for the selected stream — or the whole group after `G` (the heading shows which) |
| **Log viewer** | Full-screen page (`Enter` on an event): live tail, find/grep, table mode |
| **Event record** | Overlay (`v`): one event, every field unclipped |

### Filters & search — which one when

There are five narrowing tools, one per layer. `C` clears them all at once.

| Key | Where | What it narrows | Runs |
|-----|-------|-----------------|------|
| `/` | Group sidebar | The **list of group names** shown (also matches region) | Client-side, cosmetic |
| `/` | Streams panel | The **list of stream names** shown | Client-side, cosmetic |
| `/` | Events panel | **Which events AWS returns** — one or more [CloudWatch filter patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html) separated by `;` (e.g. `ERROR; timeout; { $.level = "error" }`). Each pattern runs as its own query and an event matching **any** of them is included, deduplicated into one timeline. Narrower patterns scan less data, so busy groups answer faster | **Server-side** |
| `G` | Group sidebar | Not a filter — **scope**: search events across the whole group (all streams interleaved) instead of one stream, with the same pattern and window. With no pattern set, `G` opens the pattern prompt first — `Enter` on the empty prompt explicitly browses everything, `Esc` backs out | Server-side |
| `/` | Full log viewer | Nothing — **find-in-page**: highlights matches, `n`/`N` jump between them, every line stays visible | In-page |
| `&` | Full log viewer | The **lines rendered** — only lines matching the regex show (like `less`), with a kept/total count | In-page |

Rules of thumb: use the list `/`s to *find* a group or stream by name; use the
events-panel `/` (plus the `p` window) when the log is busy and you only want
certain events fetched at all; use `G` when you don't know which stream an
event landed in; and inside the viewer use `/` to *locate* something while
keeping context, or `&` to *isolate* matching lines.

Applied filters stay visible: each panel shows its active filter value, the
status bar switches to `shown/total` counts while a list is filtered, and
`C` resets everything (in the viewer, `C` clears find and grep).

### [3] Log events panel

Opening a stream (`Enter`) or searching a whole group (`G`) lists matching
events. The query runs server-side (`FilterLogEvents`) over a bounded
**query window** — narrower windows scan less data, so busy groups answer
faster. The active window shows in the panel header and the status bar.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Set the server-side query pattern(s). Separate several with `;` to OR them — `ERROR; timeout` shows events matching either, across every stream when combined with `G`. Each pattern runs as its own `FilterLogEvents` query; results are deduplicated and interleaved by time. The pattern(s) also scope the full log viewer and the `D` download, so "download only the matched lines across all streams" is: `G` → set patterns → `D` |
| `p` | Cycle the query window: 30m → 1h → 3h → 6h → 12h → 24h → 3d → 7d |
| `t` | Toggle between the plain list and a zebra-striped table (the same table widget used across the app) |
| `J` | In table mode, toggle JSON splitting (on by default): structured events get one column per top-level JSON field, numbered `(1) (2) …` for orientation, with a `Message` column holding whatever wasn't JSON (plain-text events, prefixes like Lambda's `INFO` tag, suffixes). Off = plain Time / Stream / Message |
| `←`/`→` | In table mode, pan long messages sideways in 40-char steps (a `msg panned +N chars` note tracks the offset; ellipses mark text hidden off either edge). Hidden columns are revealed first, and the time column stays pinned |
| `Enter` | Open the full log viewer for the selected event's target |
| `v` | Record view: the selected event vertically, with every JSON field's **full value** (table cells clip at 80/160 chars; this is the escape hatch). Scrollable, `y` copies the record, `Esc` closes |
| `W` | Toggle live tail watch mode |
| `y` / `s` | Copy the selected event / export the listed events |
| `D` | Download **every** matching event in the query window to the downloads directory — `s` writes only the events currently listed (~100), while `D` re-queries the window in full (up to 50,000 events; the toast notes when that cap truncates). Also works from the group sidebar (whole group) and the streams panel (selected stream); the active query pattern and window apply |

With JSON splitting on, field columns come from the union of top-level keys
across the listed events in first-appearance order (capped at 24 — a
`+N more json fields` note appears when the cap bites); JSON embedded after a
prefix (`2026-08-02T10:00:00Z  INFO  {…}`) is recognized, numbers keep their
source formatting, and `null` is distinguished from an absent field (blank).
Message cells show a 160-character window so the layout stays stable; `←`/`→`
slide that window across the full text, and the whole message is always
available via `Enter` (full log viewer) or `y` (copy). The `Stream`
column appears in group-level search (`G`), where events interleave from many
streams.

### Log viewer

Pressing `Enter` on a log event opens the **Log viewer**: a full-screen
page with the entire log (the selected query window, most recent 2000 events)
for the selected stream — or the whole group in group-level search — that
streams new events live as they arrive. Each line is tinted by severity (error/fail/panic
in red, warnings amber, info/notice in the info color, debug/trace muted) so
errors stand out while you scroll.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓`, `PgUp`/`PgDn`, `Ctrl+U`/`Ctrl+D` | Scroll (scrolling up pauses tailing) |
| `g` / `G` | Jump to top / jump to bottom and resume tailing |
| `f` | Toggle follow (auto-scroll as new events stream in) |
| `t` | Toggle a table view of the streamed events — the same zebra-striped table as the events panel, with JSON splitting (`J`), message panning (`←`/`→`), record view (`v`) and per-row copy (`y`). Clear any grep filter first; follow (`f`/`G`) keeps the cursor on the newest row as events stream in |
| `J` | Toggle JSON formatting: pretty-prints JSON objects/arrays embedded in log messages (a `{} json` badge shows while on) |
| `/` | Search within the log (case-insensitive, matches highlighted; search works on the formatted lines when `J` is on) |
| `&` | Grep filter (as in `less`): enter a regex and only matching lines are rendered, with a `kept/total` count; `Enter` keeps the filter, `Esc` clears it. Invalid patterns are flagged while the last valid filter stays applied |
| `n` / `N` | Jump to next / previous match |
| `y` | Copy the entire log to the clipboard — or only the matching lines while a grep filter is applied |
| `s` | Export the log to the downloads directory (default `~/.aws_explorer/downloads`) — or only the matching lines (file suffixed `-grep`) while a filter is applied |
| `?` | Full key reference |
| `Esc` / `q` | Close the viewer |
